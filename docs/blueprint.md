- Background color: Off-white (#FAFAFA) to create a clean and bright canvas, slightly desaturated.
- Accent color: Soft grey (#D3D3D3) for subtle highlights and interactive elements, ensuring they stand out gently.
- Font: 'Belleza' sans-serif for headlines and short chunks of text. 'Alegreya' serif for longer body text. The combination of these fonts create a stylish, fashionable aesthetic.
- Use minimalist icons with a thin stroke weight to maintain elegance and consistency with the modern design.
- Implement a clean and visually balanced layout using grid and flexbox, ensuring content is easily accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Add subtle animations such as fade-ins for content and smooth transitions for the image carousel to enhance user engagement.
